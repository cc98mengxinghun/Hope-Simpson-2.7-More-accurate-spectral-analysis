In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a spline.
We used Interp Spline in processing the data of the increment and death in Covid-19. 
We firstly collected data on  April 13, 2020, then continued collecting data after every six days, while ignoring data on other days, which means that we use 7 days as a period. 
We have tried 7 days, 8 days, 12 days, 16 days, 32 days as the period, but 7 days have the best result.
